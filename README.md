## Game Description/ Rules Draft:
The game that I have chosen to create is a more simplified version of the Bay-Tech arcade game pop the lock. In this game you are tasked with stopping a spinning LED light on a designated LED light to pass a stage. Each stage will increase in speed as the game continues and will require the player to be faster as if the player presses the button when the LED is not on the designated position, they will lose and must restart. If the player successfully lands the LED on the correct location 10 times, the player will win the game. The game will also change color to show how far along the player had made it in the game.
